# vim-clojure-sql

A very simple plugin to enable SQL syntax highlighting inside strings in a
Clojure file. If you can handle the visual trip of two syntax highlighters
co-existing, this plugin will provide.

Works with the standard [vimclojure][vimclojure] plugin.

## Installation

* Be using the [vimclojure][vimclojure] plugin already!
* Install [Pathogen][pathogen]. (You're already using Pathogen, right?)
* Clone this project into `~/.vim/bundle/vim-clojure-sql`.

## Usage

Whenever you edit a Clojure file, strings starting with `"SELECT`, `"CREATE` or
`"DROP` will be highlighted as SQL.

Matches are case-sensitive, because that's my preference, but it's trivial to
fork & change the matching rules to suit your coding style.

## Notes

This repo serves as a reasonable recipe for embedded Vim syntax highlighting in
general. The next time I'm there, I'll probably write a plugin for SQL inside
Hibernate XML files. Highlighting code inside docstrings is another obvious use
of this approach.
